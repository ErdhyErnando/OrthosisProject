# lib Folder
This folder contain  **libraries for both orthosis v1 and v2 program** inside the **orthosis_lib** and also **requeirements.txt** that contain all necessary dependencies and package info inside **orthosis_lib.egg-info** folder . The author will focus on the orthosis_lib folder since the work that the Author working on is inside that folder. A modification to the documentation to include all of the files would be usefull.
