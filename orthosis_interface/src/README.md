# src Folder
this folder contain all of the source file to run the orthosis both for v1 and v2. **The program for v1** are mostly located inside the **students_work** folder while for **the program for v2** are mostly inside **ijcai** folder. In this documentation, the Author will **only discuss** the **orthosis_v2_modified.py** inside **src/ijcai/** and **orthosis_error_intro_modified.py** inside **src/student_work/variscia_thesis/** , mainly about the connection to the WebApp, since those are the one that the Author has worked on. Both file are the modification of the original files (orthosis_error_intro_ijcai_oop.py and orthosis_error_intro_mp_variscia.py). **An update that include complete explanation of other src file would be very useful.**
